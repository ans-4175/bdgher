		isi:"I found her! At last, after all this time I've spent looking for her. It all started that day when I saw her. Oh, pardon my rudeness, I must introduce myself first. My name is Hidjo, I'm a student here, in Technische Hogeschool or Institut Teknologi Bandung as it is now called. This university was built in 1918, as the first technical university in Indonesia. You can see this school's masterpiece: the two identical separate halls in the front, the East Hall and West Hall. Just look at the roof, you'll find its' local Indonesian touch, but you can definitely tell the European technology mixture there. This university is located in Jalan Ganeca number 10. And just a trivial fact, you can find the &#8220;number 10&#8221; in front of the East Hall, not many people noticed that. Oh, where was I? Her, yes I was talking about her, Kartika. I first saw her at the <b>Cathedral of St. Peter</b>. Would you kindly walk with me, trace back our meetings and help me find her?<br/>"

They are joking and laughing until one of them called her, that&#8217;s how I know her name. Among the crowd, I recognize one of them, Gatot. We've met several times for football games in one of those fields in the university during our free times. I'll probably just gonna ask him because I am too shy to talk to her directly in front of that crowd. Gatot lives in the nearby dorm called <b>Villa Merah</b>. I will check on him tomorrow, hopefully he'll help me find some clue about her."

He laughed when I asked about Kartika, he mentioned that she's a prima donna in her faculty, well, I could tell. He doesn't know where she lives, but recently she regularly visited the <b>Drie Locomotief</b>, it's a beautiful villa designed by Aalbers located in Dagostraat (Dago Street). Gatot said she needed to observe it for her sketch assignment. He didn&#8217;t mention when, but let&#8217;s see, I could just pass by every day since it is near ITB."

		isi:"This is the third day I visited Drie Locomotief, apparently she hasn't been here since then. I almost put my hope to see her to an end when I saw her walking towards me clutching her sketchbook. I froze, pretended to look elsewhere. And there I saw her took a seat, and started opening her sketch book. This Drie Locomotief, so I heard, was built in the 30s. The architect, Albert Aalbers, made beautiful and unique buildings here in Bandung, including the Savoy Homann Hotel and Denis Bank. It took me a while to gather my courage to talk to her, and when I thought I was ready, I began to walk towards her. And that's the time her friends ran pass me while calling her out loud. She smiled, packed her drawing tools, and walked with them. I heard they were going to pick up their friend at <b>Huysgenweg</b> (Dayang Sumbi Street), but all I heard was my walking away footsteps. Well, maybe it's not meant to be for me to get to know her."

Today I've just finished my part-time job, when one of my associates called me and asked me for help. He needs to deliver a package to Huysgenweg, and since it's near ITB, he thinks it would be practical if he ask me for help since I'm a student there. And I think why not, helping people won't do any harm. And so I'm in the front door of this big and beautiful house, I wonder who owns this house. A girl receives my package, she seems to be around my age, I asked her whether she's a student at ITB too, and she is, and this crazy thought led me to a specific-nothing-to-lose question. It's just a question, it won't harm anybody.<br/>&#8220;Do you know Kartika?&#8221;<br/>She was surprised with my question but she answered with excitement, <br/>&#8220;Well of course! She's my friend! Do you know her too?&#8221;<br/>&#8220;I don't. I mean, I know her, but she doesn't know me&#8230; and&#8230; I would like to meet her, would you kindly tell me where I can meet her?&#8221;<br/>What happen after that, she laughs out loud, saying that I'm crazy, but she appreciates this &#8220;sweet madness&#8221; as she calls it&#8230; so she said today Kartika probably will go to <b>the house Aalbers used to live</b>, it is located in Jan Steenlaan (Jalan Pager Gunung), she's working on an assignment about Aalbers buildings. I thanked her, and promised that I'll be a decent man that would show a good manner to her friend."
