		isi:"I found her! At last, after all this time I've spent looking for her. It all started that day when I saw her. Oh, pardon my rudeness, I must introduce myself first. My name is Hidjo, I'm a student here, in Technische Hogeschool or Institut Teknologi Bandung as it is now called. This university was built in 1918, as a first technical university in Indonesia. You could see this school's masterpiece: the two identical separate hall in the front, the East Hall and West Hall. Just look at the roof, you'll find its' local Indonesian touch, but you can definitely tell the european technology mixture there. <br/>&#160;<br/>This university is located in Jalan Ganeca number 10. And just a trivial fact, you can find the &#147;number 10&#148; in front of the East Hall (Aula Timur) not many people noticed that. Oh, where was I? Her, yes I was talking about her, Kartika. I first saw her at the Borromeus Chapel, behind the Borromeus Hospital. Would you kindly walk with me, trace back our meetings and help me find her?"

		judul:"Chapel of Smile",
		isi:"I can't forget how her smiles captivated me. I saw her that afternoon, she walked out of this chapel with her friends. I know some of them, I'll probably just ask her friend because I am too shy to talk to her directly. One of them, as I know, lives in the nearby dorm called Villa Merah, his name is Gatot. And so lets go to Villa Merah to see Gatot, hopefully he'll help me find a clue about her."
	},
	{

		judul:"Lost A Girl",
		isi:"His name is Gatot, he lives in Villa Merah since he started studying at ITB. His parents live in Central Java. We've met several times for football games in one of those fields in the university during our free times. He laughed when I asked about Kartika, he mentioned that she's a prima donna in her faculty, well, I could tell. He doesn't know where she lives, but recently she regularly visited the Drie Locomotief, it's a beautiful villa designed by Aalbers, she needed to observe it for her sketches assignment."

		judul:"Smile Walks Away",
		isi:"This is the third day I visited Drie Locomotief, apparently she hasn't been here since then. I almost put my hope to see her to an end, when I saw her walking towards me clutching her sketchbook. I froze, pretend to look elsewhere. And there I saw her took a seat, and started opening her sketch book. This Drie Locomotief, so I heard, established in 1937. The maker, Albert Aalbers made beautiful and unique buildings here in Bandung. It includes the Savoy Homann Hotel and Denise Bank. It took me a while to gather my courage to talk to her, and when I think I'm ready I begin to walk towards her, and that's the time when her friends running pass me by calling her name out loud. She smiled, packed her drawing tools, and walked with them. But I heard they were going to pick up their friend at Huysgenweg (Dayang Sumbi street), and I also heard my footsteps walking away, well, maybe it's not meant to be for me to get to know her."

		judul:"A Certain of Hope",
		isi:"It's been months since I blew up my chance to greet her in Drie Locomotief, I lost interest in pursuing further more, besides I have my school assignments waiting for me to get it done. Today I just finished my part time job, when one of my associates called me and ask me for help. He needs to deliver a package to Huysgenweg, and since it near ITB, he thinks it would be practical if he ask me for help since I'm a student at ITB. And I think why not, helping people won't do any harm. And so I'm in the front door of this big and beautiful house, I wonder who owns this house. A girl receive my package, she seems to be around my age, I asked her wether she's a student at ITB too, and she is, and this crazy thought led me to a specific-nothing-to-lose question. It's just a question, won't harm anybody. &#147;Do you know Kartika?&#148; She was surprised with my question but she answered with excitement, &#147;Well of course! She's my friend! Do you know her too?&#148; &#147;I don't. I mean, I know her, but she doesn't know me..and..i would like to meet her, would you kindly tell me where I can meet her?&#148; What happen after that, she laugh out loud, saying that I'm crazy, but she appreciate this &#147;sweet madness&#148; as she say it..so she said today Kartika probably will go to the house Aalbers used to live, it is located in Jan Steenlaan (Jalan Pager Gunung), she's working on an assignment about Aalbers buildings. I thanked her, and promised that I'm a decent man that would do a good manner to her friend."

But there she was. walking slowly between the empty street with big trees. When she arrived she can't help but noticed my presence, I smiled, and gave my hand. &#147;Hello, my name is Hidjo, i'm a student at ITB just like you, and I met you few months ago. Back then I wanted to know you but didn't have the courage to say hello to you until just now..&#148; She seemed to be surprised but smiled and embraced my gratitude with a proper shakehands, &#147;Hello, my name is Kartika, aand..i just met you, haha.<br/><br/>There was a big pause and it felt like a long long time, and I realized it's my turn to speak, &#147;well, sorry, I hope I didn't make you uncomfortable. I just..i just..well..hmm..i would like to get to know you, if I might..&#148; Awkward. &#147;well okay, haha, but unfortunately I'm in a mission to accomplish my assignment now..but..maybe we could meet again..probably..tomorrow?&#148; &#147;yes, yes, tomorrow's fine..where can I meet you?&#148; &#147;hmm.. The answer to that will be a puzzle you have to solve. haha.&#148; &#147;any kind of puzzle I'll solve it&#148; &#147;ok, meet me where the number ten is in our university..&#148; And so that's the story of how I found her. And if you go to where the &#147;number ten&#148; is now, you might see us, chatting about many things..well, you will not see us as persons since it happened a long time ago..but you might find something :)"
